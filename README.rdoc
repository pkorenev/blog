== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby 2.2.4
* bundle install
* rake db:migrate
* rake spec - to run all rspec and capybara tests

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
